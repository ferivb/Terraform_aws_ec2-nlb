# Terraform - AWS Dual Instance Deployment

This repository contains Terraform configuration files to deploy two AWS EC2 instances in two different availability zones (us-east-1a, us-east-1b). Both instances are balanced by a network load balancer. In addition a bash script is included to set up a Nginx web server listening to port 80 with a custom index page including the instanceâ€™s hostname.

The configuration will automatically update your ssh config file with the information of the EC2 instances to simplify developer access to the instances.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push

- Ubuntu 20.04 or any compatible os.
- An AWS account with full EC2/VPC permissions.
- A Terraform version compatible with Terraform v1.2.8.

## Installing

You can either deploy the AWS instances and configure the web server separately, or you can use the included user_data argument to have the servers instantiated and serving all at once.

### Ready-to-serve installation

clone/download this repository

    ```git clone git@github.com:ferivb/Terraform_aws_ec2-nlb.git```

Open main.tf with your preferred text editor and uncomment line 100

    ```code main.tf```

Initialize Terraform

    ```terraform init```

Apply the terraform configuration

    ```terraform apply -auto-approve```

### Stand-alone installation

clone/download this repository

    ```git clone git@github.com:ferivb/Terraform_aws_ec2-nlb.git```

Initialize Terraform

    ```terraform init```

Apply the terraform configuration

    ```terraform apply -auto-approve```

Secure copy the nginx-installer.sh script into each of the EC2 instances

    ```scp nginx-installer.sh ubuntu@[instance ip]:~```

Ssh into the instance and execute the script

    ```ssh [instance ip]

    ./nginx-installer.sh```
